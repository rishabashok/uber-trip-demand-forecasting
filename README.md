# Uber Trip Demand Forecasting (Janâ€“Feb 2015)
This project involves predicting daily Uber trip demand using machine learning (Random Forest, XGBoost, Ensemble models) and presenting insights via an interactive Power BI dashboard.

## Project Overview

- **Goal:** Forecast daily Uber trip volume in New York for Januaryâ€“February 2015.
- **Approach:** Clean the dataset, engineer lag/rolling features, build ML models, evaluate performance using MAPE, and visualize results.
- **Tools Used:** Python (Pandas, Sklearn, XGBoost), Power BI

## Dataset

- File used: `Uber-Jan-Feb-FOIL.csv`
- Source: [NYC TLC FOIL Uber data](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/)
- Key columns:
  - `date` â€” day of record
  - `dispatching_base_number` â€” Uber base identifier
  - `active_vehicles` â€” vehicles active on that date
  - `trips` â€” total number of trips taken that day

## Machine Learning Models

| Model           | Description                         | Avg MAPE |
|----------------|-------------------------------------|----------|
| Random Forest   | Tree-based ensemble regressor        | 7.14%    |
| XGBoost         | Gradient boosting algorithm          | 8.27%    |
| Ensemble (avg)  | Combined RF & XGB predictions        | 7.36%    |

### Features Engineered
- Day of week
- Is weekend flag
- Lag features (1-day, 2-day)
- Rolling mean (3-day, 7-day)



## Residual Analysis

Residuals were plotted to check model bias and error stability.  
- Random Forest: Stable with one large spike
- XGBoost: Higher variance in residuals

## Power BI Dashboard

### What it shows:
- Actual vs Predicted trips (by model)
- Residuals over time
- Average trips by weekday
- Fully styled with slicers and titles

### ðŸ“‚ Files included:
- `Uber_Trip_Analysis.ipynb` â€“ Full Jupyter notebook (Python)
- `forecast_results.csv` â€“ Model output for dashboard
- `daily_summary.csv` â€“ Processed data for visuals
- `Uber_Trip_Dashboard_Rishab.pdf` â€“ Dashboard export (preview)

## Key Takeaways

- Random Forest provided the most stable and accurate forecasts.
- Weekends (Saturday) showed highest average trips.
- Forecasts improved using lag + rolling features.
